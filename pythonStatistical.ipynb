    "Python's data structures (lists, dictionaries, etc.) are suitable for many purposes, but complex calculations repeated over and over again will often be slow in Python. *Numpy* was developed to create structures of data (called arrays) that are much faster in mathematical operations, in large part because the data types of all the elements in an array will be the same type. These numbers often lack the context to make the content meaningful, though. *Pandas* was developed on top of numpy to create data structures that would facilitate rapid calculation of numerical data while preserving the context that allows for the selection and manipulation of that data.\n",

    "Pandas is not included by default in Python, but can be installed and used like any other module in Python. In the documentation, pandas is usually abbreviated as pd in the import statement."

    "It will often be convenient, when performing calculations on different sets of numbers, to create sets of series that share a common index. The series will then have the same length, and mathematical operations between the series will be aligned appropriately. In pandas, this structure is called a *data frame*, and is the most common data structure used in data analyses in pandas. In addition to the common index, each series will also have a unique name and its own data type. This arrangement of data fits nicely into the tidy data paradigm, with each series representing a column of values corresponding to a particular variable (usually the name of the series), and each value in the index corresponding to a different observation or row.\n",

Reading of data from text files is generally based on the CSV (comma-separated values) format, which can be generated either by hand or by several different programs.\n",

This can be accomplished fairly readily in pandas data frames with a *groupby* method, which takes as its main argument the column (or columns, if provided with a list) that contain the categories of the data. The method returns an object that contains the groups into which the data is collected. This grouped object can be used like a list in looping structures, or it can be analyzed with *aggregating* methods that perform simple calculations on the data.\n",

To showcase another feature of pandas data frames, the resulting aggregated prices will also be displayed in a \"wide\" form, which is common for display of certain types of data. This analysis will be performed in steps, but the steps could be combined into a single line to avoid unnecessary creation of variable names."
